# React Ethereum Web3 Starter

Confused? Same. 

Hopefully the branches of this repository will help you and I come to grips with developing DAPPS!

They're the future after all! 

Here's what we've done so far: 
```
> npm init 
// defaults are fine for now
> npm install -g webpack 
> npm install webpack-cli -D 
// -D saves to dev dependancies 
``` 

This gives us a basic JavaScript setup... 
Let's next add Webpack: 

```
> npm install webpack-cli -D
> 

```
